# hyperparameter-tuning-with-random-forests
The goal of this unit is to explore how hyperparameters change training, and thus model performance. The line between model architecture and hyperparameters is a bit blurry for random forests because training itself actually changes the architecture of the model by adding or removing branches.  We will again pursue our goal of predicting which crimes in San Francisco will be resolved.

This exercise was from Microsoft's Cloud Build Challenge 2022.
